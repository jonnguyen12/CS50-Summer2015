# CS50-Summer2015

The assignments for Computer Science 50 - Intro to CS at Edx.org.

The course is from the awesome David Malan at Harvard University.

Code is written by Phuc Nguyen for sharing with other fellows. 

Please reserve the time to work on the problems first before reading these code. They are fun and helpful.

Cheers! This is CS50!
